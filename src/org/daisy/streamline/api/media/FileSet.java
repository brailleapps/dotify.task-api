/**
 * <p>Provides a file set. In its simplest form, a file set is a set of resources located in a hierarchy
 * beneath a root location. Ideally, the hierarchy only contains resources that are part of the file set.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Paths</h2>
 * <p>Each resource has a path string associated with it. The path string is relative to the
 * base folder. Ideally, the resolved path represents the actual location of the resource. However, 
 * sometimes the path string doesn't match the actual location of the resource.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>The manifest</h2>
 * <p>The manifest is the primary file of a file set, typically the one a user would
 * select as the source of a conversion. Sometimes this file also contains the primary content, such as in
 * HTML, but other times it really is just a manifest, such as in ePub 3.</p>
 * <p>The manifest doesn't have to be directly inside the base folder, it might be in another location.</p>
